Once a title and note have been entered click the save symbol on the top right to have it saved into storage. If any of the past notes on the left are clicked, they will show up in the text area to be viewed. There is a plus sign on the top right that will clear the text box for a new entry. Each note in the note history has a delete button that will remove it from the list.
